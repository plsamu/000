# POP\_OS!

The only problem, for me, is Gnome. But.\
We have this: [https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3843/just-perfection/](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3843/just-perfection/)

```
# get your gnome version
gnome-shell --version
```

Then

* installation with browser extension
* manual

### Manual

```
wget https://gitlab.gnome.org/jrahmatzadeh/just-perfection/-/archive/main/just-perfection-main.zip
unzip just-perfection-main.zip
cd just-perfection-main/
./scripts/build.sh -i
```

### Through Browser Extension

{% embed url="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3843/just-perfection" %}

### Where are the shortcut?

Accessibility.

Activities > Settings > Keyboard > Personalize

### Remote Desktop Client

* Remmina

### Tilix vs Tmux

> Tmux it always works, even with no graphical interface installed (e.g. when connected to a server using SSH) is very lightweight, and has the "detach session" feature.

So, yes...
