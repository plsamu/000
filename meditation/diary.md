```
Today I did the sixth meeting of a meditation course about mindfullness.
I still don't get it.

They say "be non-judgmental".

What the hell does that mean?

If the mind starts wander and I witness the event and
I calmly return to the object of my meditation then, I AM JUDGMENTAL!

Who am I to "calmly return to the object of my meditation"?
If the mind starts to wander I have two choices:
- follow what it does
- return to the object of meditation

The second choice, to me, seems more judgmental than the first.

If I decide to take the second choice, I am indirectly judging 
the first choice as wrong.
