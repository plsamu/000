# Licenses

### GPL license (GNU General Public License)

If your code is compiled against the GPL code, **even if the GPL code is in a separate library** (e.g. a DLL in Windows, a SDK), then your code must be GPLed as well.\
This means that **you have to make the source code available to everyone**.
