CHECK THIS
{% endembed %}

The `npm link` command doesn't work because React Native packager [doesn't support symlinks](https://github.com/facebook/metro-bundler/issues/1).

1. Use [haul packager](https://github.com/callstack/haul) in the example app. Haul supports symlinks, so you can use `npm link` as usual.
2. Use local dependency via `file:../` and then edit files in `node_modules` folder or reinstall every time you make changes.

I found [Haul](https://github.com/callstack/haul) to work great for this use-case and even set-up a [little starter project](https://github.com/pavloko/react-native-library-starter) that also includes [storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook), which is really helpful if you have many components to switch between.
