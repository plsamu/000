# Basics

* Babel is a **free** and **open-source** JavaScript **transpiler**. A transpiler (source-to-source compilers) is a tool that reads source code which is written in one programming language and produces the equivalent code in another _programming language_.
* TypeScript is an **open-source** pure **object-oriented** programing language. It is a strongly typed **superset** of JavaScript which compiles to plain JavaScript.
* import React from "react": deals with logic.
* import { ... } from "react-native": deals with graphics.
