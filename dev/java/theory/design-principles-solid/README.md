# Design Principles (SOLID)

{% hint style="info" %}
Design principles are core abstract principles that we are supposed to follow while designing software.&#x20;

**Remember they aren't concrete - rather abstract.**

They can be applied in any language, on any platform regardless of the state as long as we are within the permissible conditions.
